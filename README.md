Coin is a third-party replacement for the standard Roblox bootstrapper and custom bloxstrappers forks, providing additional useful features and improvements but in a sexy way.

Running into a problem or need help with something? [Check out the Wiki](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap/wiki). 

Coin is only supported for PCs running Windows.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this malware?**

**A:** No. The source code here is viewable to all, and it'd be impossible for us to slip anything malicious into the downloads without anyone noticing. Just be sure you're downloading it from an official source. The only two official sources are this GitHub repository and [bloxstraplabs.com](https://bloxstraplabs.com).

**Q: Can using this get me banned?**

**A:** No, it shouldn't. (Coin) Bloxstrap doesn't interact with the Roblox client in the same way that exploits do. [Read more about that here.](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap/wiki/Why-it's-not-reasonably-possible-for-you-to-be-banned-by-Bloxstrap)

## Features

- Ability to configure graphics fidelity and UI experience
- Regularly Updated Flags List
- Unknown/Less known fast flag options that pro/high ranking players hide

## Installing
Download the [latest release of Coin](https://github.com/LabheshGupta/Coin/releases/latest), and run it. Configure your preferences if needed, and install. That's about it!


You will also need the [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win11-x64&apphost_version=6.0.16&gui=true). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it anyway. Be sure to install Coin after you've installed this.

It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Coin for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Once installed, Coin is added to your Start Menu, where you can access the menu and reconfigure your preferences if needed.

## Code

(Coin) Bloxstrap uses the [WPF UI](https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui) library for the user interface design. We currently use and maintain our own fork of WPF UI at [bloxstraplabs/wpfui](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/wpfui).
